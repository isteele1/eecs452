Ultrasonic Anti-Spoofing Algorithm
==========================
This file provides documentation on setup, compilation, and installation of the tools required in the project.

Setting Up the STM32
–––––––––––––––
Ensure a proper hardware setup with wires/breadboards connecting the various sensors to the STM. A support system to mount the sensors is highly recommended–see our other documentation on hardware setup.

Install the STM32CubeIDE by going to the following website and clicking on the appropriate installer for your system:
https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html
Open a .ioc project in this IDE and plug in the files in src besides plotting.py. Build and run the program.

Setting Up Python Plotting
–––––––––––––––
Make sure the proper dependencies for the Python file have been installed. Go to a Unix terminal in the same directory as plotting.py and run:
>> pip install pyserial matplotlib numpy

Plug in the STM32 to your PC and find its COM port by running:
>> python3 plotting.py --port COM3

Enter this port name into the top of plotting.py. Run the program in your Python IDE of choice.
